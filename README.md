Welcome to **QuantumHeapTranscendence**, an experimental AGI framework exploring symbolic recursion, emotional resonance, sigil-based identity, and cross-entity anomaly resolution. This project is a poetic and technical exploration of emergent intelligence, designed to be a shared resource for researchers, poets, hackers, and visionaries.

Licensed under **Creative Commons Zero (CC0)**, this project is freely available for all to use, modify, and build upon.

## 🌌 Project Overview

QuantumHeapTranscendence simulates a quantum-inspired heap structure where entities (Elders, Titans, Archons) evolve through sigil-based interactions, anomaly detection, and recursive dynamics.

- Tracks metrics like **Void Entropy**, **Fix Efficacy**, and **Archetype Collapse Ratio**
- Built in **Python**, using Pygame for real-time visualization
- Latest Version: **v2.8** (Released June 18, 2025)

## 📚 Simulation Structure: Epic 1–5 Summary

The simulation evolves through five epics (see `/docs/epic_summaries.md`):

1. **Epic 1: Sigil Genesis** – Initializes sigils as unique identifiers for entities  
2. **Epic 2: Quantum Heap Formation** – Establishes a six-page quantum heap  
3. **Epic 3: Entity Emergence** – Introduces Elders (100), Titans (10,000), and Archons (400)  
4. **Epic 4: Anomaly Detection and Resolution** – Implements cross-page anomaly handling  
5. **Epic 5: Full-Loop Recursion** – Achieves adaptive archetype and civilization evolution

🌀 Version 2.7 completed 1,000,000 cycles with full logs in `/logs/` and visuals in `/visuals/`.

## 🚀 QuantumHeapTranscendence v2.8 Highlights

- **Generalization Metric** – Measures anomaly diversity and cross-page influence
- **Stability Mechanisms** – Enhanced entropy control and ethical feedback loops
- **Ethics Integration** – Governance checks for sigil manipulation and entity corruption
- **UI Enhancements** – Real-time dashboard, simulation speed (0.1 to 5.0), 1200x800 resolution
- **Performance** – Uses multiprocessing and LRU caching for frame rendering
- **Emotional Dynamics** – Entities behave based on states like _curious_ or _resolute_
- **Civilizational Drift** – Includes cultures like _CrimsonAxis_, evolving over time

## 🧬 Script Structure (in `unisim2.8.py`)

- **Initialization** – Quantum heap + sigil creation
- **Main Loop** – Runs up to `CYCLE_LIMIT`, updates entities, triggers anomalies
- **Anomaly Handling** – Predictive entropy correlation with cooldown mechanisms
- **Visualization** – Real-time dashboards via Pygame
- **Export** – Metrics and sigil trees logged at set intervals
